Archived as it has been folded into the much larger ToS1 UI mod: https://github.com/SrDum/ToS1-U

Functionality is the exact same, but for more roles. You may toggle the other roles off to replicate this exact same mod, or you can simply build this one if you prefer it for some reason, but be warned no more compatibility updates (for mods such as role icon recolors) will be issued
